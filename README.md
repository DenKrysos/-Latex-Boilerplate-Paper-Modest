A very basic Boilerplate for writing Scientific Papers, layouted the IEEE-way.

For a more sophisticated Boilerplate, see the one:<br/>

<br/>

Just saying, there is also another Boilerplate for Book-type Documents:<br/>

## Description
Basically, "Latex-Management", Preamble, etc.. in
* "main_frame.tex"

Actual Document's Content in
* "content.tex"

Some auxiliary stuff, like a Comment-function, glossaries and literature in
* the directory "./1supply/"



## Overleaf
The Basis for this is actually an Overleaf Project. This is linked with a GitHub-Repository and every now and then synchronized to this. So the Git-Repo is actually "only" a fork of the Overleaf-Project.


## Tips & Tricks
Some Tricks for properly handling things -- E.g. how to handle preprints, have different layouts compiled or even work with multiple "copies" of one and the same document concurrently, i.e. manage a diverging file-tree for submission of source-files -- are given within the README.md of the more sophisticated Boilerplate. Might become in handy to consult it.
