Basically, "Latex-Management", Preamble, etc.. in
* "main_frame.tex"

Actual Document's Content in
* "content.tex"

Some auxiliary stuff, like a Comment-function, glossaries and literature in

## Overleaf
The Basis for this is actually an Overleaf Project. This is linked with a GitHub-Repository and every now and then synchronized to this. So the Git-Repo is actually "only" a fork of the Overleaf-Project.
